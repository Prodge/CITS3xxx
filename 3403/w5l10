- It's better to avoid the "new" keyword where possible
- dynamic list operations:
    - Pushing and popping allows an array to be treated like a stack
    - Pushing and shifting allaws an array to be treated like a queue
- Functions should be defined before use in the page header - or linked in an external file
- Extra function arguments are ignored - no error
- Not enough function arguments will run with args as undefined
- Functions are objects
- A variable not declared using var has global scope - visible throughout the page, even if used inside a function definition
- A variable declared with var outside a function definition has global scape
- A variable declared with var inside a function has local scope visible only inside the function
    - However it is accessible anywhere within that function
        function my_funq(param){
            if (...){
                var a = 'test';
            }
            console.log(a);
        }
        >> 'test'
- can get additional function arguments from arguments[]
- Javascript objects are sumply collections of name-valeu pairs
    - They are simmilar to maps / dictionarys
