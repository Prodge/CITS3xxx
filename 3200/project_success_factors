 - Quality assurance is about meeting the needs of the customer
 - Bespoke software: tailored to a particular client
 - The client wont tell you all the good things about their present system
    - Will be more focused on the problems
 - Software projects have MANY stakeholders
 - Users don't want to spend time learning
 - Major cost is people
 - Risk management is an important part of planning
 - Plans should be regularly reviewed
 - There are complex, non-linear trade-offs between the needs of different stakeholders
 - Must find a ballance of user expectations: Capability, Time, Quality, Costs
 - Customers are going to change their mind
 - The developer is the trigger for the customer changing their mind
    - As you talk to the client about how they are going to use their system they are going to realise they haven't told you everything OR they haven't thought about everything
    - Try to stimulate this thought early on
        - Protypes
        - Detailed feature discussions
 - Users need to be trained
 - Need to be able to obtain the knowledge that the project is drifting of track asap so that it can be corrected
 - A client sign off for a spac does not gaurantee that they understand what you have written
 - Loosing a key member of staff is the bigest risk
 - Build reviews of testing and documentation into schedule
 - Start meetings with important things to get everyone engaged
 - Quality is the difference between what they expect and what you are delivering
    - You cant change what you are delivering but you can change what they expect
