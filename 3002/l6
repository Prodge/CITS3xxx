- Wireless:
- Not all nodes are in range of each other so they cannot nececarily listen to the medium to decide if its busy
- 802.11 employs collision avoidance to reduce (but not eleminate) the liklihood of collisions occuring.
    - The algoritms is terme Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (MACA), or CSMA/CA
        - Both Physical channel sensing and virtual channel sensing are employed
    - The sending node first sends a request to send packet RTS containing its address and its destination address and how long the node wants to own the medium
    - The recieving node then sends a clear to send packet CTS
    - The sending node sends its data
    - The recieving node sends an ACK
    - All other nodes that can hear these transmissions will power down for the time specified in the CTS / RTS
- Although two modile nodes can communitace directly, the more usual approach is for all communications to be through fixed access points
- A mobile node 'associates' with a single access point if all of its communications are via that point.
    - All such nodes form a cell
- The mechanism emproyed by a mobile node to select an access point is termed active scanning
    - the mobile client node sends Probe frames,
    - all access-points within range reply (if they have capacity) with a Probe Response frame,
    - the mobile node selects an access-point and sends an Association Request frame, and
    - the access-point responds with an Association Response frame.
- An alternative is for an access-point to use passive scanning:
    - the access-point periodically sends Beacon frames advertising its existence and abilities (e.g. supported bandwidths),
    - the mobile node may choose to switch to this new access-point using Disassociation and Reassociation frames.
    - When a node selects a new access-point, the new access-point is expected to inform the old access-point using the distribution system.
- Attacks against wireless networks
    - Physical layer attacks
        - Attackers of wireless networks need not be close to the network infrastructure
        - An attacker may develop a device to simply saturate the frequency bands with RF noise
            - This reduces the signal to noise ration making it difficult to discern any valid signal
    - Data link attacks
        - It is simple to configure a laptop and its wireless card to masquerade as an access-point
            - If a victims node associates with the access point the attacker can monitor or drop all traffic from the victim
- As wireless is a shared medium, all traffic may be intercepted by a potential intruder
- WEP keys need to be distributed in some mannar
- If WEP traffic is logged enough, the wep key can be determined
- 15gb is reqiured for table based attacks
