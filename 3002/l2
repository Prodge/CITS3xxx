- Physical link layer responsibilities
    - Provides the physical topology of the network
    - Provides the transfer medium
    - Encodes data into a transmission signal supported by the medium
    - Monitors for transmission errors
    - Detects arriving signal levels to synchronise speed and timing
- Data link layer responsibilities
    - Constructs data frames using the format of the physical layer
    - Creates cyclic redundancy codes (CRC) information
    - Checks for arriving errors using CRC information
    - Initiates and arbitrates the link to reduce interruption and contention
    - examines arriving and passing device addresses in data
    - Retransmits data if there is an error
    - Acknowledges reciept of a frame
- UDP
    - no validation of reciept
    - Smaller implementation
    - Faster runnning
- Latency = propogation delay
    - Round trip time (RTT) is twice the latency
- Throughput is usually the measured number of bits per second (actieved), while bandwidth is the nominal (peak) number of bits per second possible
- TLatency  =  TPropagation + TTransmit + TQueue
    - TPropagation  = distance / speed-of-propagation-in-medium
    - TTransmit     = message-size / bandwidth
    - TQueue        = time-spent-in-local-and-remote-operating-system-and-switch-queues
- Rates of transmission errors are described by their probability of occuring or by their expecter bit-error-rate (BER)
- Transmission errors usually occur by bursts and are caused by:
    - Thermal background noise
    - Impulse noice (~10ms duration)
    - Distorted frequency
    - Crosstalk
    - Reduction of dynamic range and noice (companding)
- A Burst begins at the first corrupted bit and ends at the last corrupted bit
    - Not all the bits between are necessarily corrupted
- How data is placed in frames:
    - Simple timing gaps between frames cannot be used as all hardware devices run at slightly different speeds; resulting is sqewing over time
    - Special prefix and suffix characters ane used to envelope the data
- A digital signal is a sequence of descrete, discontinuous pulses or signal elements
- If all signal elements have the same voltage, they are termed unipolar
- The modulation rate of a lan in the number of signal elements per second or the baud rate
- To correctly interpret the signal, the receiver must know the length (time) if each signal element and the expected voltage levels of the bits 0 and 1
- The two simplest encoding schemes are the (these do not offer synchronisation):
    - Non return to zero level (NRZ-L)
    - Non return to zero inverted (NRZ-I)
        - An example of differential encoding in which the signal transition rather than the signal level indicates the value of each bit
- biphase encoding ensures that there will be a transition in the middle of each bit:
    - With tratitional manchester encoding the mid-bit transition provides a chocking mechanism (as well as the data)
    - With diferential matchester the mid-bit transition privides the chocking and the initial transition provides the data
    - Biphase encoding schemes have at least one transition per bit time
        - Therefore the makimum modulation rate (or baud rate) is twice that for the NRZ-L and NRZ-I
        - Invalid signals can be detected when the mid-bit transition is not present
-}}}
- Data can be modified so that errors can either be:
    - Detected: you can only tell that the data is wrong
    - Corrected: you can unambiguously tell what the data should have been and hence confidently correct it
- Correction is requesed where communication must be simplex (only possible in one direction), but the correction is expensive
- Codewords are constructed consisting of both data and check bits
- The Hamming distance between two codewords consissts of the number of bit positions in which the differ
    - The difference is performed by modulo-2 or XOR
- The Hamming destance of a code is the mimimum hamming distance between any two words in that code
- The extra bits used to detect errors are called checksum bits
- A polynomial is represented by a bit string with 1 for each power represented by the polynomial and 0 otherwise
- 16 bit checksums catch:
    - All single and double bit errors
    - All errors with an odd number of bits
    - All burst errors <= 16 bits long
    - 99.997% of burst errors = 17 bits
    - 99.998% of birst errors >= 18 bits
- CRCs are often performed in hardware
