- Satellite broadcasting
    - Many users share a single channel
    - Propogation at the speed of light
    - The distance traveled is large resulting in round trip times of ~300ms
    - Bandwidth is less limited by the speed of local infrastructure
    - Cost is the same whatever the distance.
    - Satellite acts as a repeater of incoming signals
        - Amplifying and re-breadcasting these signals
- The advantages of a shared medium approach:
    - No ack's needed as each sender can verify the correctness of their own messages (as they can hear them)
- Conventional channel allocation:
    - (Sharing a medium)
    - Polling:
        - Either the satellite or a ground station offers the channel to an individual user for a specified amount of time
        - Delays make this impractical
    - Frequency and time division multiplexing
        - Frequency division meltiplexing allocation (FMA)
            - The channel is divided into n frequency bands for a maximum or n users
            - Guard bands are placed beteen these to limit interference
        - Time division multiplexing allocation (TDMA)
            - The channel is dividedinto slots based on time intervals - typically 125 usec
            - Each potential user may then use the whole channel for their time quantum
            - This is simmilar to OS timesharing
        - FDMA and TDMA are very inefficient since the actual number of users 'm' is generally way less than 'n' or way more than 'n' and is often bursty
        - CDMA
            - A shared algoritms allows each node what frequency to use ahead of time
            - Frequent frequency hopping over time
- Local area networks:
    - A LAN is a routerless network, using the same protocol stack for each device, and using only a uniform, local, networking media.
    - Machines connect to a (logically) single cable within a 1km radius (often the same building or campus).
    - Total data rate > 10Mbps (short round trip time, simple data link layer with, say, a one bit sliding window)
    - Single organization ownership (no political domains to traverse).
    - Usually use broadcasting (no routing problems, but everyone sees all frames).
- Carrier sense networks:
    - All stations can sense the electrical carrier before sending
    - This is possible because of the use of high speed cables over short distances
    - We will be concerned with carrier-sense multiple-access networks (CSMA)
    - Factors affecting CSMA lans
        - Frames are of constant length
        - No transmission errors - other than collisions
        - No capture effect
        - A station may not transmit and recieve immidietly
        - Each station can sense the transmission of others
        - The random delay after a collision is uniformly distributed and large compared to the frames' transmission time.
        - Frame generation attempts (OLD and NEW) form a Poisson process with mean G frames per time.
    - In persistant protocols each station first senses activity on a channel
        - If two stations A and B are waiting for C to finish, they just pause for a period, and when they sense that the channel is free, transmit with a probability of 1
            - This results in a good chance of collision
        - The longer a propagation delay on a LAN the more collisions there will be and, hence, the worse will be the performance.
    - In non-persistant and p-persistent protocols, each station may again sense a busy channel
        - If the channel is found to busy, contending stations 'back off' for various intervals
- IEEE-802.x Lan Standards - The Ethernet System
    - Uses a 1-persestent carrior-sense multuple-access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) method
    - Each packet must be at least 64 bytes long to provide some reasonable chance of detecting collisions over long-ish propogation times
    - Each segment of ethernet cable cannot exceed 500m due to power losses
- Ethernet contention algorithm
    - Each station waiting to transmit, listens to the other and on finding it silent begins the transmission
    - On detecting a collision a station:
        - Backs-off for a random period
        - After the first collision each station backs-off for 0 or 1 slot times before trying again
        - If there is a second collision, a station backs-off for 0-3 slot times
        - In general a station will back-off from 0-2^(i-1) slot times after the ith collision
    - This method is termed binary exponential back-off
    - This insures a short delay for each station when a number of stations collide and a reasonable delay when masy stations collide
- Intefearence detection
    - Each transeiver has an inteference detector
        - A station can detect intefirence betause what it is recieving is not what it's transmitting
- Multiple lans can be bridged together
    - A bridge can connect two topologies of the same family of notwork protocols:x
