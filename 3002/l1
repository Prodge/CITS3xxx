- Mid Semester Test:
    - Short answer questions
    - 10-12 Questions
- Project needs to be resiliant to attacks
- Previous projects have been open ended (there have been no perfect solutions to them)
- Computers are autonomous if there is not a permanent master/slave relationship between them
- A computer network is an interconnected collection of autanamous computers
- Security is a mental activity:
    - Security vulnerabilities need to be constantly thought about
    - It's not something that can be set and forgot
- Need to determine the potential threats inorder to implement the appropriate solutions
- Active threats:
    - Botnets (needs a host program)
    - Self reproducing worms
    - Rootkits
- Passive threats:
    - Keylogging
    - Packet sniffing
    - EMF monitoring and bridging air-gap networks
    - Simple social engineering
- What is vulnerable:
    - People (social engineering)
    - Practices (using out-of-the-box configurations)
    - Programs
    - Protocols
- Threat countermeasures:
    - Improved education
    - Reduced system complexity
    - Increased software testing
    - Improved physical protection
    - Improved authentication
    - Improved authorization
    - Increased use of biometrics
    - A Better understanding of encryption
- Cryptography is a process / mindset
- A computer protocol consists of an agreed format for messages expressed by a packet header, an optional message component and a set of rules for the enchange of messages between computers
- OSI model: Open systems interconnect moel
    - Allows for a protocol standard that people can write their own implementations for
    - Encourages that the software is written in layers
        - A Given layer is only responsible to the layers above and below it
- ISO: International standards organization
- TCP: Transmission control protocol
- Network layer functions:
    - Routing
    - Relaying: Enables data transfer across networks
    - Flow Control: Matches traffic flow with the physical capacity of a transmission path
    - Sequencing: Ordering of frames across a network
