- The data link layer provides the following services between the physical and network sayers:
    - Bundling and unbundling groups of bits into frames for the physical layer
    - Throttling the flow of frames between the sender and reciever
    - Detecting and correcting higher lever transmission errors such as the sequencing of packets from the network sayer
- Simplex: The sender sends frames without waiting for the reciever to acknowledge them
- half-duplex: each frame sent is individually acknowledged
- Full-duplex: Each frame is individually numbered and is gauranteed by the data link layer to be recieved once and only once and in the right order.
    - The result is that the data link layer presents a reliable frame stream to the network layer
