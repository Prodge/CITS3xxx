- Vertex shader applications
    - Geometric transformations
        - Change relative location, rotation, scale
        - 3D perspective transformation - make far objects smaller
    - Movinng vertices
        - Morphing
        - Wave motion & deformation due to physical forces
        - Particle effects
        - Fractals
    - Lighting
        - Calculate shading colour using light and surface properties
- There are no pointers in GLSL
