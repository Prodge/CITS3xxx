- WebGL is more simple
- Projects are given with skeleton code
- Ray tracing:
    - Follow rays of light from a point source finding which rays enter the lens of the camera
    - Each raw of light may have multiple interactions with objects before being absorbed or going to infinity
- Luminance Image:
    - Monochromatic
    - Values are grey levels
    - Represent each pixel using one byte
- Colour images:
    - RGB values
    - Has perceptional attributes of due, saturation, and lightness (HSL)
- Human vision:
    - Rods: Monochromatic, night vision
    - Cones:
        - Colour sensitive
        - Three types of cones
        - Only 3 values (RGB) are sent to the brain
        - More Red and green cones (blue < 5%)
            - Less sensitive to blue light
- Aditive colour:
    - Form colour by adding amounts of RGB
- Subtractive colour:
    - Form a colour by filtering white light with cyan, magenta and yellow filters
    - Adding them together gives black
    - Colours become darker the more added
    - Good for printing
    - CMYK
