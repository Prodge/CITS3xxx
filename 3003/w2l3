- Vertex processing:
    - Converting from one coordinate system to another:
        - Object coordinates
        - Camera coordinates
        - Screen coordinates
    - Every change of coords is equivalent to a matrix transformation
    - Also computes colours
- Projection:
    - The process that combines the 3D viewer with 3D objects to produce the 3D image
    - Perspective projection: All projectors meet at the centre of projection
    - Parallel projection: Projectors are paralles, center of projection is replaced by a direction of projection
- Primative assembly:
    - Verticies must be collected into geometric objects before clipping and rasterization can take place:
        - Line segments
        - Polygons
        - Curves and surfaces
- Objects that are not within view are said to be clipped out of the scene
