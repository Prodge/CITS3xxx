- Handling noisy data
    - Binning
        - Partition data into equal frequency bins
        - Then data can be smoothed by bin means / medians or bin boundaries
        - Equal width partitioning:
            - Divides the range into n intervals of equal size
            - If a and b are the lowest and highest values of the attribute the width of the intervals will be:
                W = (B - A) N
            - Skewed data is not handled well
            - Outliers may dominate presentation
        - Equal depth (frequency) partitioning
            - Divides the range into N intervals, each containing approximately the same number of samples
            - Good data scaling
            - Managing Categorical attributes can be tricky
    - Regression
        - Smooth by filtering the data by regression functions
        - Outliers are removed because you are fitting your data to a smoothed function
    - Clustering
        - Identify data point clusters
        - Can be visually identified when plotted on a 2d plot
        - Points outside of clusters are treated as outliers
- Data cleaning:
    - Data descrepancy detection
        - Use metadata (legal values, dependancy, distribution)
        - Cleck field overloading
        - Check for:
            - Uniqueness rule: data should be unique
            - Conservative rule
            - Null rule: whether a value should be null or not
    - Data migration tools allow tronsformations to be specified
    - ETL (Extraction/Transformation/Leading) tools allow users to specify transformations through a graphical user interface
    - Schema integration: integrate metadata from different sources
    - Detecting and resolving data conflicts:
        - Different units of measurement
- Redundant data can often occur when integrating multiple databases into one
    - These values may be able to be detected by correlation analysis
        - Chi square test and contingency table for correlation analysis
            - Contingency table looks at frequency of values occuring
- Plots with lots of lines can be produced as a 3D chart
