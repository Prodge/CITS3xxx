- Multimodal data: a dataset that contains more than one mode (2 most commonly occuring values)
- No mode when each value only occurs once
- midrange - The average of the min and max of the dataset
- Positivley Skewed - Mode < Median
- Negativley Skewed - Mode > Median
- Quantiles - dividing the data into equal-sized subsets
- Interquartile range = Q3 - Q1
- 5 number summary:
    - Median
    - Quartiles Q1 and Q3
    - Smallest and largest individual observations
- Outliers - 1.5 x interquartile range above Q3 or below Q1
- Variance is only used when the mean is considered as the centre of the dataset
- Quantile plot - Sort the dataset into ascending order and construct a matching list for Fi
    - Fi = (i - 0.5) / N
- Scatter plots show correlation and skewedness
- If attributes correlate, then we can use only one of those attributes
- Loess curve - Add a smooth curve to a scatter plot to provide better perception of the pattern of dependence
- Data pre-processing
    - Data cleaning
        - Fill in missing values
        - Smooth noisy data
        - Remove outliers
        - Resolve inconsistencies
    - Data integration
        - Integration of multiple databases, Data cubes or files
    - Data transformation
        - Normalizationand aggregation
        - Convert to different units
    - Data reduction
        - Obtains reduced representation in valume but produces the same or similar analytical results
        - Remove correlated atributes
    - Data descretization
        - Part of data reduction but with particular importance, especially for numerical data
- Data is likely to originate from multuple hetrogeneous sources
- Dirty data:
    - Incomplete data
        - Lacking attribute data
    - Noisy data
        - Faulty data collection instruments
        - Data entry error
        - Errors in data transformation
    - Inconsistant data may come from
        - Different sources
        - Violation of functional dependancy
        - Lack of standardisation
    - Duplicate data
- Data quality can be measured by: * = important
    - Accuracy*
    - Completeness*
        - No missing attributes
    - Consistancy*
        - The degree to which all required attributes are filled in
    - Timeliness
        - Updated regularly
    - Believability
        - Trustworthy data
    - Value added
        - Informative and non-redundant
    - Interpretability
    - Accessibility
    - Uniformity
        - The degree to which a set of data measures are specified using the same units
- Handle missing data:
    - Missing data may need to be inferred based on regression or bayesion formula or decision tree
    - Ignore the tupple
    - Fill it automatically with a global constant eg. 'unknown'
