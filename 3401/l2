- Frequent patterns (frequent item sets): what items are frequently purchased together
- Association, correlation vs casualty:
    - A typical association rule:
        - Milk -> bread (0.5%, 75%) (support, confidence)
- Classification and label prediction:
    - Construct models based on some training examples or rules
    - Supervised learning:
        - You have the features and a known category
    - Describe and distinguish classes or concepts for future prediction
- Cluster analysis
    - Unsupervised learning:
        - Class label is unknown
- Outlier analysis:
    - Most data mining methods discard outliers
- Sequential pattern, trend and evolution analysis
    - trend, time-series and deviation analysis
    - Sequential pattern mining
        - eg. buy digital camera, then buy sd card
    - Periodicity analysis
        - Evolution patterns over time
Data warehousing
- A data warehouse is:
    - Subject oruented
        - Organised around major subjects (eg. customer, suppleor, product ...)
        - Focusing on the modeling and analysis of data for desision makers (not concentrating on daily operations)
    - Integrated
        - Constructed by integrating hetrogeneous (can come with different schema) data sources
        - Data cleaning and data integration techniques are applied
            - Ensures consistancy in naming conventions, encoding structures, etc. among different data sources
    - Time-variant
        - The time horizon for the data warehouse is significantly longer than that of operational systems
            - Operational database: Current value data
            - Data warehouse data: provide information from a historical perspective
        - Every key structure in the data warehouse Contains a seperate key
    - Non volatile
        - Operational update of data does not occur in the data warehouse environment
        - A phycically seperate store of data tranformed from the operational evnironment
- The purpose of a datawarehouse is to support decision making
- Data warehouse (OLAP) (on-line analytical processing)
    - no need for concurency support
    - Optimised for query throughput
- Operational DBMS (OLTP) (on-line transactional processing)
    - Major task of a relational dbms
    - Day to day operations
    - Optimised for transacton throughput
- Enterprise warehouse:
    - Collects all the information about subjects spanning the entire organisation
    - Collects both detailed and summerised data
- Data mart
    - Contains a subset of corporate data that is of value to a specific group of users
    - Summerised data
        - User specific detail is removed for privacy
    - The scope is limited to selected subjects
- Virtual warehous is a set of views over operational databases
    - For efficient query processing, only some of the possible summary views may be materialized
- A data warehouse allows for:
    - Historical data which operational DB's typically do not maintain
    - Data consolidation from difference sources
    - Data quality can be improved by processes of cleaning data and reconciling different formats
- Information processing
    - Supports querying, statistical analysis and reporting
- Analytical processing:
    - Multidimensional analysis of data warehouse data
    - Supports basic OLAP operations, slice-dice, drilling, pivoting
- Data mining
    - Knowledge discovery from hidden patterns
    - Supports associations, constructing data models, performing classification
- A data warehouse is based on a multidimensional data model
    - Data cube: Base cube, apex cube, concept of heirarchies
    - Schemas: Star, snowflakes, fact constellations
    - Operations: slice-dice, drilling, pivoting
- A data cube is organised around a central theme such as 'sales'
    - It allows data to be modeled and viewed in multiple diensions
    - It's a metaphor and doesn't actually confine models to 3d
- Star schema:
    - Consists of one or more fact tables referencing any number of dimesniosal table
    - The fact table contains a key reference for each dimensional table which correspond to certain measures
- Fact constellation - Galaxy schema:
    - Multiple fact tables sharing attributes from the dimensional tables which correspond to their own calculated measures
